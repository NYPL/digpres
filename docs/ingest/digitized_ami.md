New York Public Library began digitizing at-risk audiovisual media around 2005. The assets result from
the digitization are called Digitized Audio and Moving Images (AMI). The original media include film reels,
audio films, analog and digital cassettes, analog open reels, etc. The digitization was performed on-site
by the [Media Preservation Labs](https://nypl.github.io/ami-preservation/pages/amiLabs/ami-labs.html) or
offsite by approved vendors coordinated with the [Media Preservation Services](https://nypl.github.io/ami-preservation/pages/mps/mps-about.html).
