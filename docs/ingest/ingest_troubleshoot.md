Ingesting content into Preservica encounters issues from time to time.
Digital Preservation program uses below methods to understand the cause and
resolve them prior to ingest.

## How are issues spotted?

There are a few ways that we check if the ingest process encounters any blockage.

* Exception log file: "Exception log" is a plaintext file generated by the ingest script,
  and it lists the file(s) that are not included in the package staged for ingest.
  This is the first file to check, in case there are files not included in the package.

* Workflow status on the Preservica website ingest monitor: after logging into Preservica,
  click Ingest > Monitor, and the screen will show all the processes. A workflow status
  indicates whether the ingest was successful. If the ingest workflow completed
  successfully, there will be a green check mark for the package. If the workflow has
  issue(s), there will be an orange check mark. On the same page, there is a section that
  lists all the messages, "Info", "Warning", "Error". Successful workflows can sometimes
  include "warning" and "error" messages for some issues, such as filename encoding error.
  How we navigate what the actual causes are will be introduced in the next section.
