## Preprocessed Archives: File Transfers from original media carriers

Preprocessed Archives packages that are the direct transfers from the media carriers. Therefore,
they are also known as File Transfers (FT). The direct transfer process is conducted by the Digital Archives team.
More information can be found at [Digital Archives File Transfers documentation page](https://nypl.github.io/digarch/transfers/file-transfers.html).
The following diagram show how this type of package may look like.

Preprocessed Archives package")

The top-level folder should be named after the digital carrier ID, e.g. ACQ_1234_123456.
This top-level folder should also include a "metadata" and an "objects" folder.
Within the "metadata" folder, there should be a CSV file, named with the same media carrier ID.
Within the "objects" folder, it should have one or more files, which can be in folder structures.
