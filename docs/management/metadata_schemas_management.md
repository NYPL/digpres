# Metadata Schemas Management

Digital Preservation (DP) Program utilizes customized metadata schemas in
the digital repository, Preservica, in order to connect ingested assets with
other systems used at the Library. We are storing minimal metadata, essentially
the system identifiers, so as to reduce repetitive work, because the existing
systems are used to provide descriptive metadata for our collections.

The system identifiers we store in Preservica metadata fragments will assist
us to create relationships and connect ingested assets with other databases
such as ArchivesSpace, SPEC (NYPL's collection management system), Sierra,
and other identifiers like barcode, division code, etc.

As the metadata schemas are customized, and are updated with time, DP Program
keeps track of the schema documents we use in a private GitHub repository,
[NYPL/prsv-schemas](https://github.com/NYPL/prsv-schemas).
