## About Digital Preservation
Digital preservation ensures reliable long-term access to digital objects. To avoid that definition being a meaningless string of words:

* ensures - documenting, monitoring, and auditing are more valuable to preservation than heroic interventions
* reliable - systems break, staff change, new types of things are collected, but we're still responsible for preservation
* long-term access - if an access system isn't sustainable into the future, it isn't really accessible
* digital objects - it doesn't matter if it's digitized or born-digital, the collection's 1's and 0's require preservation

There's no one true way to do digital preservation, but any digital preservation program will need people, technology, and organizations.
