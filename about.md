## About the Program
The NYPL Digital Preservation program ensures reliable long-term access to library's digital objects by:

* documenting workflows
* monitoring of storage
* auditing processes
* direct preservation actions

The program began in December 2015. It also aims to contribute to the digital preservation community by sharing the results of its work through presentations, code repositories, twitter, and this blog.
